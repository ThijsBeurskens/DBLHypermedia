                   The Master program Computer Science and Engineering is a two-year program of 120 ECTS in total. The academic year is subdivided into two semesters, the fall semester starting in September, and the spring semester starting in February. It is possible to enter the program at the start of either semester; however, starting in September is preferred. The program is only offered as a full time study program. The CSE curriculum is structured in streams, which provide an organized set of courses in particular subject areas within computer science. The streams provide guidance for the directions in which you can specialize, and ensure that you choose a comprehensive and coherent set of courses. When you enroll to the CSE master you should choose a stream right away because this determines the list of mandatory courses and the assignment of a mentor. The streams are: <br>
Software science <br>
Web science <br>
Systems science <br><br>
Each stream has the same structure:<br>
5 EC CSE mandatory course<br>
20 EC Stream mandatory courses<br>
20 EC Stream elective courses<br>
40 EC Free electives<br>
5 EC Seminar<br>
30EC Master project<br><br>
Each stream has a number of mandatory courses, and a selected set of elective courses from which at least 20 EC should be chosen. There is great flexibility in defining the remaining part of your individual study program from all courses that are offered by the computer science department (40 credit points). Within this remaining part you should include 15 credit points in international experience if you do not have it yet and are not doing your master project abroad. To prepare for the master project, you take a seminar course from one of the computer science research groups. In the following sections, more details for each of the streams are given.<br>
                </p>
                <br><h2>Web science stream</h2>
                <p>
                    Over the past decade the use of web-based systems has exploded. Buying clothes, books, and DVDs, booking hotels, checking the weather forecast, contacting your friends: all of this is done on the internet nowadays, and novel web-based applications are developed every day. The CSE stream Web Science focuses on the technology behind these developments. In the stream you learn techniques needed to design intelligent and reliable web-based systems, their role in online business and you learn to analyze the use of such systems. As a graduate of the Web Science stream you <br></p>
                    <ul>
  <li>have knowledge of the principles and technologies that drive the Web</li>
  <li>have the skills to design effective web-based systems, and to analyze existing web-based systems and the data generated through their use</li>
  <li>can design intelligent information services using semantic-web technology or machine-learning techniques</li>
<li>have insight into business, privacy and security issues related to web-based systems</li>
</ul>
               <p>If you want to specialize more in the data-analysis aspect of Web Science you should consider the special track on Data Science in Engineering.</p>

<br><h2>Software science stream</h2>
            <p>
Innovative software systems are the driving force behind many exciting developments in society, industry, and science. However, designing software systems that function correctly, efficiently and securely, is far from easy. The CSE stream Software Science focuses on the formal techniques and technology you need for this. You learn model-driven engineering techniques to increase the quality of computer programs. As a graduate of the stream Software Science, you <br> </p>
                  <ul>
  <li>have in-depth knowledge of techniques needed to model and design efficient and reliable software</li>
  <li>understand the strengths and weaknesses of these techniques and can apply them in the appropriate situation, taking limitations of cost, time, and other resources into accounte</li>
  <li>can analyze existing software systems and understand the fundamental issues involved in software maintenance</li>
</ul>
                <br><h2>Systems science stream</h2>
                <p>
High-tech systems are defined by a tight interaction between physical systems and computing systems. They are often called “Cyber-Physical Systems”. They are characterized by complex architectures and complex interactions between physical sensors and actuators control, computation, and communication. In the CSE stream Systems Science you study these new technologies and the process to develop them. Protocols, interfaces and algorithms need to be designed to improve (energy) efficiency and automation. Larger systems are never built from scratch anymore, but composed from existing building blocks. An understanding of the essential structures and behaviors of a system - the architecture, laid down in models - is therefore essential. Models are further used to validate often using mathematically based methods and monitor required qualities (reliability, robustness, safety, security and privacy), and to drive the implementation. Experimentation and on- line methods (like self-monitoring) are essential ingredients. As a student graduating in the stream Systems Science you </p>
<ul>
    <li>are familiar with the architectures and architectural principles of large-scale software systems</li>
    <li>are capable to apply complex model-based methods required for the rigorous functional and quantitative analysis of system behaviors</li>
    <li>understand the role of software—foundations as well as processes and tools—in its interaction with hardware and sensors in large-scale software-intensive systems</li>
                </ul>
<br><h2>Free stream</h2>
                <p>
The streams have been set up such that they provide a structured set of courses related to important topics in computer science. The “free stream” enables you to follow a different program. In any case you have to take the CSE mandatory course together with the four mandatory courses from one of the predefined streams (Software Science, Web Science or Systems Science) but then take a set of electives that does not contain 20 EC from the stream electives of that stream. You have to ask permission to the Examinations Committee, and motivate why you cannot set up a desired individual study program that falls within one of the streams.
A commonly accepted reason for choosing the free stream is to follow a teacher-training program with courses and other credits from the Eindhoven School of Education (ESoE) aimed at obtaining a teaching degree (with or without going for a double degree). Instead of 20 EC in stream electives plus 40 EC in free electives you then take only 15 EC in electives from your chosen stream plus 45 EC as teacher training program.
